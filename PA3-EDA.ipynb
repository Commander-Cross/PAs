    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For this programming assignment, we are going to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of three real-world datasets that contain interesting insights. To do this, we will **implement our solutions for each dataset in their own Jupyter Notebook. The three Jupyter Notebooks will share common, re-usable utility code in .py modules.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter Notebook should be well-organized with interleaved code cells and markdown cells. Here are general requirements that your Notebooks should conform to:\n",
    "* Your EDA story should be appropriately labeled using markdown headers for at least the dataset description, preparation/cleaning (if necessary), and exploration\n",
    "* Your EDA story should consist of a well-written narrative describing the dataset-specific code, in-line charts (with labels!!), results, and insights you come up with for each step\n",
    "* Non-dataset-specific code should be designed/implemented as generic and re-usable functions (that can be used for future programming assignments and data mining tasks)\n",
    "    * Put plotting-related functions in `plot_utils.py`\n",
    "    * Put other functions in `utils.py`\n",
    "* Each formula that you use in your code must be typeset using Latex and described in markdown\n",
    "    * E.g. formulas used for stats and linear regression/predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes regarding `MyPyTable`:\n",
    "* Copy your `MyPyTable` from PA2\n",
    "* You are encouraged (but not required) to use `MyPyTable` to store the data in tables\n",
    "    * Feel free to add additional methods to `MyPyTable` that implement standard table behavior\n",
    "* Do not modify the signatures of existing `MyPyTable` methods from PA2 (future unit tests may call them)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: we are learning data science from scratch! The only non-standard Python library you should need to use for this assignment is `tabulate` and `matplotlib`. This means that beyond these libraries, you should not `pip install` any additional libraries beyond what is included in the [continuumio/anaconda3:2022.05](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker image and you should not use `pandas/numpy/scipy/`etc..."
